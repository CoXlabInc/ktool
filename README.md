# Ktool

**Ktool** is the **enhanced** version of [**kflash.py**](https://github.com/kendryte/kflash.py) utility.

It is compatible with **_kflash.py_** but introduces many new features and enhancement.

Full sources of the enhanced 2nd stage **ISP** are available in this repository's **src/isp** directory.<br>
More information and build instructions are available in the **build** directory.

<br>

### How it works

* On start, K210 board is **reset** into **bootloader ISP** mode by holding the K210 **IO16** low and asserting the **reset** pin.
* After reset, if `IO16` is low, K210 executes the **1st stage ISP** from **ROM**.<br>
1st stage ISP is only capable of loading K210 program to the requested SRAM address and execute it.
* After the communication with the _1st stage ISP_ is established, **ktool.py** uploads the **2nd stage ISP** to the K210 SRAM and executes it.
* All further communication is performed via **2nd stage ISP**

<br>

### Features:

* Compatible with standard _kflash.py_, the same command line options are supported
* Uses highly optimized 2nd stage **ISP** binary which loads in less than a second and supports many new features
* Write firmware or data to **any** SPI Flash **address**
* Write firmware/data using **4K** **chunks** and 4K **alignment*<br>(_kflash_ always writes 64K chunks and the firmware address must be 64KB aligned)
* **Read** Flash content to file is supported
* **Erase** the SPI Flash chip
* Reports SPI Flash chip manufacturer's **JEDEC ID**, **64-bit unique serial number** and **size**
* Optionally swap **endianess** on data write (useful when writing some kind of data, for example filesystem image)
* **Load** the firmware to **K210 SRAM** end execute it.<br>Loading is done by the 2nd stage ISP and can be performed **at any baudrate** supported by the board.<br>It is now possible to load and start large firmwares at high speed...
